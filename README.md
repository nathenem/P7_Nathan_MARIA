# Groupomania - P7 Openclassrooms

This is my realization for the 7th openclassrooms project. The project consists of a website in the form of a corporate social network for the client "Groupomania".

## Install dependencies :

Do not forget to install both back and front dependencies. Lists are into the back and front folder README.md files.

## Run the project :

### Starting API

Go to back directory with `cd back` and start the API using `nodemon server.js`

### Starting client

Go to front directory with `cd front` and start the website client using `npm start`
